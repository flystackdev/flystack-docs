FlyStack Aviation is an API built for product and engineering teams creating travel and aviation experiences: flight tracking, operations, customer support, reporting, consumer apps, internal tools, and more.

We collect, normalize, and structure data from multiple sources so you get a consistent foundation you can trust—without having to manage the complexity upstream.

<Note>
  This documentation is provided for demonstration purposes only. All endpoints, parameters, and example data are fictitious.

## What you can build with FlyStack Aviation

- Track flights in near real time and enrich your tracking screens
- Power support workflows with useful flight information (status, delays, etc.)
- Work with aviation reference data (airports, airlines, fleets, routes…)
- Feed alerts and dashboards for operations teams
