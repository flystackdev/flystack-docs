## Operating Principle

FlyStack works with an asynchronous job system. Here are the steps to use a job:

1. **Create a Download Job**
   - Make a request to `GET /api/v1/jobs` with the job parameters
   - You'll receive a `job_id` in response

2. **Monitor Job Status**
   - Use the received `job_id` to check progress via `GET /api/v1/jobs/{job_id}`
   - You can make this request as many times as needed at no additional cost
   - The status can be:
     - `QueuedJob`: The job is being processed
     - `CompletedJob`: The job is complete

3. **Get the Result**
   - Once the job is complete (`CompletedJob`), you'll have access to the download URL in the response
   - The job result remains available on our servers for 24 hours
   - You must download it to your own server to keep it longer

## HTTP Status Codes

- `201 Created`: Job successfully created and queued for processing
- `200 OK`: Successfully retrieved job status or download information
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input (malformed parameters, unsupported job type)
- `404 Not Found`: Job ID doesn't exist

## Processing Time

Jobs typically take between 2 and 30 minutes to complete. If processing hasn't finished after 2 hours, the job will automatically timeout.

## Error Handling

If the job fails, it could be due to several reasons:
- The job parameters are invalid
- The job result is no longer available
- The job result has age restrictions
- A technical error from FlyStack

In all cases, you will receive an explanatory error message. In case of technical errors, please contact our support.

<Note>
  Job results are automatically deleted from our servers after 24 hours. Make sure to save them before this time if needed.
